(** * Function signature.

The function signature captures three things about a function in the
target language. The ordered list of its parameters, the local
variables, and the allocated registers. These information is relevant
for generating the entry/exit code for the function (what registers
need saving etc) and the C prototype for the function.

(** * The Target configuration module.

A target for verse needs to implement a module with the following
signature that abstracts out various target specific details of the
generator.

*)

Module Type CONFIG.

  (** A statement of the target language *)
  Parameter statement : Type.

  (** ** Two phase code generation.

     Every target that is supported comes with a type system.  Code
     generation for a given target is given by two piece of
     information.

     - A monoidal semantics where the underlying monoid is essentially
       a list of target language statements (+ errors) and the [types]
       is the target language types.

     - A type compiler from [verse_type_system] to the target type
       system.
   *)

  Declare Instance
          target_semantics : semantics (list statement + {TranslationError}).

  Parameter typeCompiler : TypeSystem.compiler verse_type_system types.

  (**
     The compilation of verse code to the target languages then
     happens in two phases. In the first phase, a type transformation
     is done keeping the code the same. The errors that are generated
     in this phase are type checking errors, which occurs when we use
     a variable or a constant in verse that does not have its
     corresponding type in the target. One can see this phase as a
     type relaxation from the richly typed verse language to the
     weakly typed target language. This phase is completely taken care
     of by the structural compilers available in [Code.compile] and
     [Iterator.compile] which makes use of the type compiler
     [typeCompiler]. So the nothing other than a [typeCompiler] is
     required to perform this phase.

     On successful completion of the first phase, we get the same
     structural code as the source but with the underlying type system
     being that of the target type system. We then need to convert
     this code into actual target specific instructions which is taken
     care of by the monoidal semantics. One can think of this as the
     instruction selection phase of the "compiler" and unsupported
     instructions lead to translation errors. To make this compilation
     phase predictable, a property that is critical in ensuring that
     hidden side channel leaks do not happen during compilation, it
     should be the case that verse code should more or less be
     translated verbatim and anything which is more complicated than
     the instruction set of the target should result in a translation
     error.

   *)



  (** *** Compiling Iterators.

      Iterators process a stream of blocks each of which is
      transformed by the code available through the [process] field of
      the [iterator] record. The [streamOf] type captures the type in
      the target world that corresponds to stream of type [blocks].

   *)

  Parameter streamOf  : typeOf types memory -> typeOf types memory.

  (** The [dereference] function allows us to index the current block
      that is being acted on by the [process] fragment of the iterator
   *)
  Parameter dereference  : forall {block : typeOf types memory},
      variables memory (streamOf block) -> variables memory block.

  (** The [mapOverBlocks] applies a set of instructions on a single
      block and iterates it over all the blocks in the stream. It
      starts at a point in the stream, runs the given list of statements
      and advances the stream to the next element of the stream.
   *)

  Parameter mapOverBlocks :
    forall {block : typeOf types memory},
      variables memory (streamOf block) ->
      list statement       ->
      list statement.

  (**
     Finally we need to package a function in the target language given its
     signature and its body of statements.
   *)
  Parameter programLine  : Type.
  Parameter makeFunction
    : forall name : Set,
      name
      -> funSig types variables
      -> list statement -> programLine.

End CONFIG.

(** * Code generation

    Using a target configuration module captured by the module
    signature [CONFIG], we now give the code generation module that
    compiles straight line function and iterators written in verse to
    the target language function.

 *)

Module CodeGen (T : CONFIG).

  Import T.

  (** The code generation function only needs three things to
      complete its code generation, the allocations (in the target
      variable) to hold the parameters, local variables, and the
      register variables for the function/iterator. Having got these
      three, it essentially just generates code by filling in these
      allocations and using the config module [T] to get the final
      target AST. The core is thus pretty simple but we need a lot of
      boilerplate to make the types work out.

      - We need to convert the allocation that we have (these are in
        terms of target variables) into that of the source variables
        so that they can be filled into our [scoped] source code. This
        is achieved by the function [toVerseAllocation].

      - The filled source code (the type system being that of the
        verse language) needs to be "typeChecked" and transformed into
        target type system. This is achieved by the function
        [typeCheckedTransform].

      - We then need to convert these type checked and transformed
        code into the target specific ast for which we make use of the
        functions from the config module [T].

   *)

  Definition toVerseAllocation    := Scope.Allocation.coCompile T.typeCompiler.
  Definition typeCheckedTransform := Code.compile T.typeCompiler.

  (** To carry out these transformation, we also need compatibility of
      the allocation types which the following predicate asserts *)

  Definition compatible n st ss := Scope.Types.compatible (n:=n) T.typeCompiler st ss.

  (* begin hide *)
  Arguments toVerseAllocation [n st ss] _ [v].
  Arguments typeCheckedTransform [v].
  Arguments compatible [n].

  (* end hide *)

  (** The essential arguments for the code generator are the
      allocations to parameters, local variables, and register
      variables. However, to get to that point, we need a large number
      of auxiliary types and helper functions. We package all these
      into the following section.  *)

  Section Shenanigans.

    (** The set of possible names of the function. At the code
        generation stage the user can instantiate it with a particular
        set.  *)

        generated. *)

    (** ** Allocating target variables.

        The variables of the verse program when translated to the
        target code needs allocations over target variables. We have
        allocations for parameters, locals, and register variables for
        the function. In addition, we need a variable for the stream.

     *)

    Definition streamType := T.streamOf streamElem.

    (** Both iterators and ordinary straight line functions now need
        their allocation for their parameters, local variables and
        registers. The next set of section variables build towards
        this. *)

    Variable rCompat : compatible rts rvs.


    (** Having captured all the above types we now get to the three
       relevant arguments to the code generator namely the allocation
       used to hold the parameters, locals and register variables on
       the target side.  *)

    Variable params : Scope.allocation variables pts.
    Variable locals : Scope.allocation variables lts.
    Variable regs   : Scope.allocation variables rts.

        to variables in the verse world. *)
    Definition verse_params := toVerseAllocation pCompat params.
    Definition verse_locals := toVerseAllocation lCompat locals.
    Definition verse_regs   := toVerseAllocation rCompat regs.

    (** Finally, there are two additional variables that we need on
        the target side which does not occur in the parameters, locals
        or registers --- the [blockPtrVar] which needs to be set by
        the caller to point to the starting block and the
        [counterVar], which needs to be set to the number of blocks
        that needs processing. Since these two variables are to be set
        by the caller, they become additional parameters to the
        iterator function.
