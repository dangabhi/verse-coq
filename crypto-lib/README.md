# The Verse low level crypto library.

This directory contains the complete self contained source code the
verse _low level cryptographic library_. This library is *not* a
standalone cryptolibrary and is only meant to provide the
implementation of low level cryptographic primitives that can be
called other higher level libraries in C (or any other language that
supports FFI to C). The C and Assembly source code that comes with
library is not meant to be edited as the themselves are generated
using the Verse eDSL.
