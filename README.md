Verse
=====

A domain specific language in coq used to write low-level
cryptographic primitives.


Configuring and installing
--------------------------

```
./configure.sh
make

```

Building with multiple coq-versions
-----------------------------------

You need `opam` for building and testing the source code for multiple
versions of coq. You need to set the the environment variable $COQ_VER
and run the script `./scripts/opam-build.sh`. Here is an example.

```
COQ_VER=8.6 ./scripts/opam-build.sh build  # compile all the coq files
COQ_VER=8.6 ./scripts/opam-build.sh html   # build html documentation

```

Generating C code from Verse file
---------------------------------

You need to have an `ocaml` installation to generate C code.

Add the following lines to your Verse program (check `src/TestCode/TestCode.v`)

```coq
Require Import Verse.Extraction.Ocaml.

(* testcode being the code object *)
Definition main : unit := print_code testcode.

Recursive Extraction main.
```

The c code can be generated by piping the output to `ocaml`. For example

```bash
 coqc src/Verse/TestCode/TestCode.v -R src Verse | ocaml -stdin
```
