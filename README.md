Verse
=====

A domain specific language in coq used to write low-level
cryptographic primitives.

Configuring and installing
--------------------------

Verse has been tested with coq versions 8.6 and 8.7. It also required
the coq-color library. It is best to use opam to build the project.

## Setting up the coq environment.

We assume that you are using opam-2 in which case you need to
initialise it with the `--disable-sandboxing` option. Otherwise the
package coq-color used by verse will not compile.


```bash
opam init  --disable-sandboxing  --compiler "$OCAML_VER"
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam update
```

You will now need to get a version of coq. Select one of the coq
versions for which verse is tested (8.6 or 8.7).

```
opam install coq."$COQ_VER"
opam pin add coq "$COQ_VER"
opam install coq-color
```

Finally prepare the opam environment, configure, and then make.

```
eval $(opam config env) # set up opam environment if needed.
./configure.sh
make

```

Programming in Verse
--------------------

Verse is an _Embedded Domain Specific Language_ and as such generates
the assembly language code as a Coq inductive type. Here is a tiny example
which takes an array of 16-bit words and sets it to zero.

```coq

Require Import Verse.


Section ZeroBuffer.

  (* Paramterise over program variables *)
  Variable v   : VariableT.
  Arguments v [k] _.

  (* The buffer argument *)
  Variable buf : v (Array 10 bigE Word16).

  (* Define what variables are paramters, what are local variables on
    stack and what are allocated in registers *)

  Definition parameters : Declaration := [Var buf].
  Definition stack      : Declaration := [].
  Definition registers  : Declaration := [].

  (* Zero the ith entry of the buffer *)
  Definition  zeroIt (i : nat) (pf : i < 10) : code v.
    verse [ buf[- i -] ::== Ox "0000" ].
  Defined.

  (* Loop over all the indices of buffer *)
  Definition zeroBuf : code v := foreach (indices buf) zeroIt.

End ZeroBuffer.

```

See the directory Verse/Artifact/ for more examples.


Extraction of code
-------------------

In the example above, we wrote a simple verse program. To get actual code
targeting a real machine, we need to compile for a given architecture. Here
we illustrate the use of portable C as the architecture.

```coq
Require Import Verse.Arch.C.

Definition code : Doc + {Compile.CompileError}.
  Compile.function "zeroblocks" parameters stack registers.
  assignRegisters (--).
  statements zeroBuf.
Defined.
```

Now that we have compiled the above verse program into the coq
variable `code`.  The recommended way to get a string representation
of the program is to export it to ocaml and print it. This is achieved
as follows.

```coq
(* Extracting the code

*)

Require Import Verse.Extraction.Ocaml.

Definition main : unit := print_code code.
Recursive Extraction main.
```

We can then pipe the extracted code through the ocaml interpreter to
get the actual code.

```bash
 coqc src/Verse/TestCode/TestCode.v -R src Verse | ocaml -stdin
```

# A bigger example: libverse

A larger example for actual extracted code is [libverse], a small
low-level cryptographic library primarily meant for being embedded in
other high level libraries. All the primitives in [libverse] are
implemented in [verse][repo], the coq source for which resides in the
sub-directory `src/Verse/CryptoLib`. A snapshot of [libverse] is built
for this coq source using the helper scripts, and makefile present in
the directory `crypto-lib`.
